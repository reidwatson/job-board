# ðŸŒŸ Reid's Job Board - Full Stack Demo

Here is my excercise in the tech stack from the job description -- spring boot api / mysql db / react frontend. It has some simple job board features that I got from using the product: Browse job listings, see jobs on a map near me (prototype), search for jobs, post a job, apply for a job, see my applications. It uses very basic auth with salted + hashed passwords in the mysql db.

I have never made a spring boot api from scratch before, or used mysql despite many years working with sql servers, and thought this would be fun. I heavily relied on Claude sonnet 3.7 with Cursor to build this in less than 24hrs -- so there are certainly some bad pracices in this repository ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ”— Live Demo

You can access the production site at [https://reidsjobboard.com](https://reidsjobboard.com).

## ðŸ’» Technical Skills Showcase

I wanted to showcase my skills as a full-stack developer:

- **Frontend**: React + Vanilla CSS + Typescript + Vite app
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.5 + Java + MySQL API
- **DevOps**: Ubuntu VPS hosted + Nginx reverse proxy + Certbot SSL

## ðŸ“š Documentation

You can read the README.md files in the `/jobboard` and `/web` projects for more project structure information (these were generated by Claude).
